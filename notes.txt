ORGANISING CODE BASE design pattern
-organise code base by features:
eg. Using a single folder for each feature/page of the app containing all relevant files and data for a component
-->some components might exist on all pages layout so use a global folder
- try to keep a flat folder (avoid excessive nesting) structure without having too many files in each folder

--> In this project = 
added src/components (multiple page use components)
+ src/scenes for single page components 
+ src/global (for global components) 
+ src/theme.js file to setup: 
++ colors and tyography light/dark mode using Tailwind Shades extension 
++ mui theme settings function to return token based on mode 
++ react context variable with createContext() function for color mode toggling 
++ useMode function to store  mode state
++ set 'theme' with useMemo() function to memoize the theme object.
